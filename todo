[] - controls to move camera in world space. Should be easy, by moving the viewpoint offsets. see input tutorial, and the offsets are where 12.0f is in main.c
[] - Render multiple objects.
[] - Figure out why very high poly objects break rendering.


There should be a table or file for the world/map data.
It should have entries of what index the tile is, and what the filename.
[1, 2, 3, 4 ]
[5, 6, 7, 8 ]
[9,10,11,12 ]
[13,14,15,16]

This should facilitate easy unloading and loading dynamically.
For now, just have it render 16 flat planes, but once collision is implementated, move to shapes.
