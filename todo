Need to deallocate chuncks to far from user. Model struct has a pointer to STLModel, which is allocated in stlloader.h
good, can allocate and free model without having to mess with the array of objects.
I think if we were going to have 1m models on the ground, it would be better to check every few hundred frames how long a model has been invalid
swap and pop the array of pointers to models. Change modellist to use Model* models[maxmodels], will have to allocate on the heap and figure out a way to free the stuff.

[] - Make the ground system have checking if you are within a radius of the plane to load it.
[] - tiling ground system. Should load an stl for each tile, just planes for now. see down below
[] - Collisions. I have made the decision to only support rectanglular prism collisions. Each Model struct supports up to 10 colliders rn. easy implementation, also really cheap
[] - Textures? what does it take on psp?
[] - image loading. load them into textures
[] - skybox but only after the above one is completed
[] - overlay, image or text. Would help with debugging and leads to menus later
[] - abstract away controls
