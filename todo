IMMEDIATE GOAL:
Implement a list of all objects, render all models in the list every frame. Then implement tile loading based on this.

[] - Make the ground system have checking if you are within a radius of the plane to load it.
[] - tiling ground system. Should load an stl for each tile, just planes for now. see down below
[] - Collisions. I have made the decision to only support rectanglular prism collisions. Each Model struct supports up to 10 colliders rn. easy implementation, also really cheap
[] - Textures? what does it take on psp?
[] - image loading. load them into textures
[] - skybox but only after the above one is completed
[] - overlay, image or text. Would help with debugging and leads to menus later
[] - abstract away controls
