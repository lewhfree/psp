The next step is to implement async loading. Model should get a new flag called isLoading. When you start to load it, you set the flag to one. When the flag is 0, the model is loaded
Keep this flag seperate from the isvalid. Isvalid is if the memory has been allocated. Isloading is for async laoding. 

[] - Make the ground system have checking if you are within a radius of the plane to load it.
[] - tiling ground system. Should load an stl for each tile, just planes for now. see down below
[] - Collisions. I have made the decision to only support rectanglular prism collisions. Each Model struct supports up to 10 colliders rn. easy implementation, also really cheap
[] - Textures? what does it take on psp?
[] - image loading. load them into textures
[] - skybox but only after the above one is completed
[] - overlay, image or text. Would help with debugging and leads to menus later
[] - abstract away controls
